The global financial crisis (GFC) or global economic crisis 
is commonly believed to have begun in July 2007 with the 
credit crunch, when a loss of confidence by US investors in 
the value of sub-prime mortgages caused a liquidity crisis. 
This, in turn, resulted in the US Federal Bank injecting a 
large amount of capital into financial markets. By September
 2008, the crisis had worsened as stock markets around the 
globe crashed and became highly volatile. Consumer confidence 
hit rock bottom as everyone tightened their belts in fear of 
what could lie ahead.
